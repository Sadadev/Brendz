        <p>
          Every business requiring expatriate staff in Nigeria must obtain the statutory approval permitting it to employ expatriate.
          The different processes leading to the issuance of these approvals and permits (work/residence permit) are quite long and most times
          challenging. We at BRENDZ are very knowledgeable and conversant with the entire process. Our approach is based on profiling each contact 
          person in the application process and deploying a robust professional relationship, which ultimately facilitates the flow of work and 
          guarantees timely deliverables.
          Below are the various approvals that we can help you to process:
  
        <ul>
          <li>Establishment Grant of Expatriate Quota position</li>
          <li>Business Permit (required for companies owned either wholly by foreigners or jointly owned by foreigners and
            Nigerians)</li>
          <li>Additional Expatriate Quota position</li>
          <li>Re-designation of Quota position</li>
          <li>Renewal of Quota position</li>
          <li>Upgrading of existing Quota position</li>
          <li>De-tagging and Extension of Non-renewable Quota positions</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                TWP visas are for expatriates who are taking up short term employment in Nigeria (usually for installation
                and
                commissioning work). The nature of these assignments is usually very technical such that the expertise
                cannot be sourced
                locally. The approval of a TWP cable (a process which precedes obtaining TWP visas) is at the discretion
                of the
                Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service.
